# guess-the-number

This is a simple guess the number game built with flask.

To run the game, simply clone the repo and run:
$ pipenv install
to install dependencies.
Then, run main.py and play the game!

The app will spin up a Flask server on localhost port 5000, and it will automatically open the page.
On navigating away from the game, closing out of the window, or completing the game, the app will kill the flask server.
